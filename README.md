# cs234 Final Project

Name: Alexander Waitz

Title: Empirical Investigation of Reward-Free Skill Discovery Behavior

Apologies for the messy repository. Only the most recently updated

There is lots of material to do with attempts to use my own PPO/SAC that
ultimately was not used in producing results.
